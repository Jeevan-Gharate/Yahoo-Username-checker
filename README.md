# Yahoo-Username-checker
This Really Simple and Dry Python Script is Super fast .. Obviously not Faster than light... checks if the Username is already taken on the platform called YAHOO
now if you are here i assume you already know about YAHOO unless you are not still living under bunch of rocks.

I utilized my noob python scripting skillz to check if the username is already taken (on yahoo ofc,)

install the modules used and put bunch of usernames to check in username.txt and run the script booom 💥 Valid.txt file will be created with all the avaiable usernames

I WILL UPDATE THE REPO PROPERLY ONCE I GET FREE TIME *or some money 😅😘* ... 💲⌚💲
